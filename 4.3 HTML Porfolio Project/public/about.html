  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I am an aspiring IT and business professional currently developing my skills in both fields through education and practical experiences. I am working towards a BSc (Hons) in Computing & IT at The Open University, where I am building a solid foundation in software development, networking, and business integration. My studies have given me the chance to explore key areas such as project management, data analysis, and cloud computing, particularly with Microsoft Azure. I am also actively participating in a Web Development Bootcamp, where I am gaining hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, and Web3 technologies.</p>
  <p>Though still early in my career, I have already gained valuable exposure to various tools and technologies, including Microsoft Office Suite, Google Workspace, and Slack, along with basic programming skills in Python and JavaScript. Additionally, my work experiences in customer service and translation coordination have helped me hone my organisational, communication, and problem-solving skills. I am eager to leverage these abilities in roles that will challenge me and help me grow professionally, particularly in IT support or administrative positions.</p>
  <p>My multilingual abilities—fluent in Spanish and Catalan, proficient in English, and conversational in French and Dutch—have been an asset in every role I've held, allowing me to navigate diverse environments and communicate effectively. I am committed to continuous learning and professional development, with the aim of contributing to dynamic teams and projects in the IT and business sectors.</p>
